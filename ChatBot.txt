
I want to create a chatbot website that uses the Google Gemini API. The website should have a dark, modern, and futuristic design, inspired by the following theme:

Background Color: #0B0C10 (very dark blue-black)

Primary Accent Color: #66FCF1 (bright aqua glow)

Secondary Accent Color: #45A29E (greenish-teal)

Text Color: #C5C6C7 (light gray)

Font: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif

Animations: subtle glowing effects on buttons, cards, text headings

Glow animations similar to 'subtleGlow', 'textGlow', and 'borderGlow'

Smooth scrolling and responsive layout for mobile and desktop

Modern shadows and blurred background effects (like glassmorphism)

Light and Dark mode toggle (optional but preferred)

Website Functionality Requirements:
A clean and smooth chat interface for conversations
Typing animation while the AI generates responses
Save chat history locally (localStorage or IndexedDB)
Secure handling of Gemini API keys (hide them securely)
Sticky Header and Sidebar Navigation (optional)

Additional Requirements:
Typing effect for user and AI messages
Responsive mobile view and desktop optimization
Smooth hover transitions on buttons and input fields
